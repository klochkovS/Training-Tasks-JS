/**
 * Bob is preparing to pass IQ test.
 * The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others.
 * Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness.
 * Help Bob â€” to check his answers,
 * he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness,
 * and return a position of this number.
 * ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test,
 * which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
